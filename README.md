# Griphoton
*by Pia Schroeter*

**The game started out as university project for the course Games Programming (2. Semester 2022)**

*In this game, the player ends up in a parallel world called Griphoton and has to fight monsters in dungeon levels to return to the player's world. The player has to solve puzzles given by ghosts living in Griphoton to get more vital for the dungeon. The game is a 2D mobile game, and the player walks around the world to find houses with ghosts and their puzzles.*
